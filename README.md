it's only for MAC user for now. it is going to be updated for all the OS(windows, linux) till wait.

think it can do:

1. it can let you search the meaning of word.
2. it will open any app in your MAC.
3. it can show show you the current process running in your system
4. it can make and remove directory from any location


to run this command:
    
    #cd downloads (where you have downloaded your webserver.py file location)
    
    #chmod +x webserver.py( to give permission to the code to run)
    
    #python webserver.py (to run the code)
